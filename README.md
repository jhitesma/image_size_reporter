# Image Size Reporter

Chrome extension I whipped up to help identify image sizes on a webpage.

When it's running anytime your window resizes it will do the following:

1) Add a span after each <img> tag with the rendered size of the image and the original size of the image
2) Generate a line of output in the console for each image showing the src | ID | classes | rendered size | original size

This is just a quick proof of concept so far to see if it helps our designers.
